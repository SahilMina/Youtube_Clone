This repository contains a clone of YouTube
home page, created by me using HTML and CSS
through the guidance of YouTube and Google 
along with countless trial and run methods.
This is my first Project, meant to prepare 
me for creating my portfolio from the very
basic and expand my knowledge.

I hosted this HTML page online twice,
by using Netlify through manual 
deploy and GitHub pages  for practice.


GitHub deployed:- https://sahilmina.github.io/Web_Development/
